        Hi, I'm Yaron ( Ya • rone ) — a Product Designer based in beautiful
        Connecticut, where I live with my amazing wife, two wonderful daughters,
        a goofy pup, and a grumpy old cat. I’ve worn many hats in the past 25
        years — product designer, entrepreneur, mentor, and strategist. I’ve
        worked for world-class companies, built startups from scratch, led them
        to profitability or acquisition, and even experienced the thrill of an
        IPO as an early-stage employee. Outside of work, you’ll find me reading
        historical non-fiction, making music, cooking up a storm, or traveling
        to new places. Welcome to my website, feel free to poke around.
      </p>
